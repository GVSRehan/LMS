Student Library Management System
Overview
The Student Library Management System is a Python-based console application designed to facilitate the management of books within a library and interactions with students. The system allows students to perform various actions such as borrowing, returning, and donating books, while providing administrators with tools to manage the library's inventory.

Key Components
Library Class: The Library class manages the core functionalities of the library, including displaying available books, borrowing books, returning books, and accepting book donations. It maintains a list of available books and tracks books that are borrowed by students.
Student Class: The Student class represents a student entity and provides methods for students to interact with the library system. Students can request to borrow, return, or donate books through this class.
Controller: The Controller class acts as the main controller of the application, orchestrating interactions between the model (library) and the view (console interface). It initializes the library and handles user inputs to execute appropriate actions.
Model: The Model class defines the data structure and logic for managing books and student interactions. It maintains information about available books, borrowed books, and student activities.
View: The View class represents the user interface of the application, presenting information to users and capturing their inputs. It displays menus, prompts, and messages to guide users through various operations.
Utilities: The Utilities class provides utility functions used across the application, such as loading images and creating timers.
Features
Book Management: Students can browse the list of available books, borrow books, return books, and donate books to the library.
User Interaction: The system provides a menu-driven interface for students to perform actions conveniently.
Tracking: The system tracks borrowed books and displays information about the borrower, facilitating book management and retrieval.
Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures that invalid inputs and exceptional scenarios are handled gracefully, providing feedback to users.
Usage
Launching the Application: Execute the Python script to start the Student Library Management System.
Interacting with the System: Choose from various options presented in the menu to perform actions such as listing books, borrowing, returning, or donating books.
Managing Library Inventory: Administrators can track book borrowings, monitor inventory status, and maintain library operations efficiently.
Future Enhancements
User Authentication: Implement authentication mechanisms to restrict access and ensure security.
Database Integration: Integrate a database to store book details, student information, and transaction history for scalability and persistence.
GUI Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
Advanced Features: Explore additional features such as book categorization, reservation system, notifications, and reporting functionalities.
